# Our Hobby Farm

Our Hobby Farm is a web application that helps pet owners keep track of their pet care tasks.

After a user logs in, he/she can add pets, check off that they have completed care tasks, update pet info, see who is in their household, invite new users to their household, upload pictures of their pets to their gallery, and send an email to a pet sitter with all of the care information they inputted when adding or updating a pet.
